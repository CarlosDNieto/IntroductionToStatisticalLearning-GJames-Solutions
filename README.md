# An Introduction to Statistical Learning by Gareth James - Solutionary in Jupyter Notebooks

---

This is a repository with the solutions to the excercises of the ITSL book by Gareth James. 

I'll orginize this repo by chapter and in each chapter I'll do a Jupyter notebook where I solve the problems that correspond to each of the chapters.
